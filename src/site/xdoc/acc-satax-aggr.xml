      <p>Keywords: Multi sales taxes, aggregate tax rate.</p>

      <p>* New features described in this article available in version 1.1.7 (in source code right now).
      </p>
      
      <h4>Multi sales taxes. Aggregate tax rate for item basis method.</h4>
      <p>In case of multi sales taxes per item you can (or must according the law) use this method.</p>
      <p>This method is useful only for "due on item basis" method. 
        Aggregate tax rate for multi-taxes gives different tax result (against "non-aggregate").
        For example tax1=11%, tax2=1.6%, tax3=3.3% for two lines (4.56USD and 51.13USD):
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
A.non-aggregate:
item  price tax1  tax2  tax3  total t.tax
1     4.56  0.5   0.07  0.15  5.28  0.72
2     53.13 5.84  0.85  1.75  61.57 8.44
total taxes 9.16

B.aggregate tax (15.9%):
item  price atax  total
1     4.56  0.73  5.29
2     53.13 8.45  61.58
aggregate tax total 9.18
</pre>
The difference is 1 cent for each line. Difference is 2 cents for totals.
      </p>
      <p>
This is performance friendly method, cause no need to keep multiply tax entries for each invoice line.
      </p>
      <p>This method allows to implement "taxes are included in price" with "no problems".</p>
      <p>Total taxes are calculated from total of aggregated tax, for example above:
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
tax1 = 9.18 * 0.11 / 0.159 = 6.35
tax2 = 9.18 * 0.016 / 0.159 = 0.92
tax3 = 9.18 - (9.35 + 0.92) = 1.91
</pre>
To prevent difference between total aggregate from lines and total taxes cause grouping rounding error,
the last tax total line is the rest of aggregate tax.
      </p>
      <p>Accounting Settings property "Use aggregate tax rate or only tax (item basis)" is used to switch this method, default is false.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Example of sales invoices for both methods (aggregate and not).</h4>
      
      <p>
        Set "invoice basis" method to false and add new invoice with two services with prices and taxes that described above:
        <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/staggr1.png" /></p>
        <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/staggr2.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>
        Set "Use aggregate tax rate (item basis)" method to true and add new invoice with two services with prices and taxes that described above:
        <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/staggr3.png" /></p>
        <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/staggr4.png" /></p>
        <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/staggr5.png" /></p>
