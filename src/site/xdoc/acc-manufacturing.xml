      <b>Beige-Accounting automatically calculates cost of product = cost of materials
       plus additional costs (direct labor, packaging etc), this method is widely used in many countries.</b>
      <p>
        Rob has made on Jan 17 12 Pizza with bacon frozen and 12 Pizza with cheese frozen. Where are two documents for manufacturing:
        <ul>
          <li>Manufacturing process that makes a <b>product in progress</b> by using materials and usually direct labor cost, and makes accounting, draw material and warehouse entries</li>
          <li>Manufacture. It just transfer completed <b>product in progress</b> into <b>finished product</b>, and makes accounting, draw material and warehouse entries</li>
        </ul>
        Bob has filled manufacturing process for 12 Pizza with cheese frozen:

        <p>Field <b>Site from</b> in use material line is optional. If it's empty then withdrawal will be from the first warehouse
        site/s with available item/s.</p>
        <p>Bob has added one half of direct labor cost 45.91 (22.955) from Inventory capitalized cost temporary according Wage full report.
        After completing and accounting full report is:</p>
        <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting manufacturing report" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/manufacture-process2.png" /></p>
        <p>
          Then Bob has filled and accounted Manufacture based on Manufacturing process above:
          <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/manufacture1.png" /></p>
          <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/manufacture2.png" /></p>
        </p>
        <p>
          Bob has made the same documents for 12 Pizza with bacon frozen.
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>* You have to make sure: are you (your business activity) subject to this method (product cost) according the law?</p>
