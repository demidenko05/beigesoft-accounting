  These expenses usually don't require to track payments to its vendor(supplier), and usually they don't include taxes.
  So accounting of such expenses is very simple.
  Bob rent kitchen at Jan 13 with equipment for 1000 per month. The document lease is a prove that says that rent expense is occurred
  at last day of every month for 1000USD even unpaid (accrual method).
  <h4>Accounting of prepaid rent.</h4>

  <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting prepaid rent" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/prepaid-rent.png" /></p>
  <p>
    According <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/capitalization-period-of-direct-and-indirect-costs">IRS Capitalization Period of Direct and Indirect Costs</a>
    rent expenses must be capitalized, so at Jan 31 one month rent is occurred and Bob will makes adjusting entries:
  </p>
  <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting rent occurred" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/rent-occurred.png" /></p>
  <p>
    Bob will make same entries in February and March.
  </p>
  <h4>Accounting of unpaid rent.</h4>
  <p>
    In April Bob will not paid rent on time, so he will makes entries for occurred rent expense:
  </p>
  <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting rent occurred unpaid" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/rent-occurred-unpaid.png" /></p>
  <p>
    When Bob will paid rent for April, he will makes accounting entries:<br></br>
    <pre>Debit Accrued Payable for Rent Credit Cash In Bank for 1000 USD</pre>
  </p>
  <h4>Accounting of paid rent on time.</h4>
  <p>
    When Bob will paid rent on time, he will makes accounting entries:<br></br>
    <pre>Debit Inventory Capitalized Cost for Rent Credit Cash In Bank for 1000 USD</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    If according the law of your country rent expense isn't required to be capitalized then it's used directly gross income (business) expense account <b>5150 Expense.Rent</b> instead of asset account <b>1210 Inventory Capitalized Cost.Rent</b>.
