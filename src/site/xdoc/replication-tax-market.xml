    <section name="Database replication from tax to market accounting specification #1.">
      <p>This is about data replication from Tax accounting (records are made according Tax Law rules)
        to Market accounting (records are made according market rules),
        e.g. in tax accounting bad debt must be reported at the end of the year after being approved by authority,
        but in market accounting - immediately.
      </p>
      <p>Data to be replicate are: accounting entries (filter applied) and subaccounts (Products, services, etc.)</p>
      
      <h4>Interactive filter of accounting entries</h4>
      <p>User can elect accounts to avoid they replication</p>
      <p>Filter final (plus filter for immutable APersistableBase) string should be like:
      <pre>
         where (ITSID>0 and IDDATABASEBIRTH=2135) and ((ACCDEBIT isnull or ACCDEBIT not in ('BadDebts')) and (ACCCREDIT isnull or ACCCREDIT not in ('BadDebts','Property')))
      </pre>
      this filter disabled property deprecation entries and all bad debts entries.
      This filter is implemented with <b>org.beigesoft.replicator.filter.FilterAvoidAccDebtCredit</b>.
      </p>
