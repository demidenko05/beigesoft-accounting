    <section name="Export price list into CSV file.">
      
      <p>Keywords: export price list into CSV file.</p>

      <p>* New features described in this article available in version 1.1.7 (in source code right now).</p>
      
      <h4>Export price list into CSV file.</h4>
      <p>Right now Beigesoft™ Accounting has implemented only method "item price for price category", i.e. "product1[price for shop in downtown]=12.34".
        Price methods that based on "base price" are not yet implemented. Price list is available in "Web-Store" part.
      </p>
      <p>The aim of this topic is exporting product list into a POS. You can also make price CSV lists for your customers (B2B).</p>
      <p>There is no standard of product list data in CSV file for POS. For example, different POS require different tax formats, e.g. multi-tax TAX5% and TAX6%,
        product1(TAX5%,TAX6%), product2(TAX5%), product3(non-taxable) (aggregate rate is not allowed):
        <ul>
          <li>POS1 required:
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Product,ProductCode,Price,TaxMethod
product1,1,12.4,TAXMETH1
product2,2,11.41,TAXMETH2
product3,2,4.6,
</pre>
          </li>
          <li>POS2 required:
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Product,ProductCode,Price,UseTax5%,UseTax6%
product1,1,12.4,true,true
product2,2,11.41,true,false
product3,2,4.6,false,false
</pre>
          </li>
          <li>POS3 required:
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Product,ProductCode,Price,Tax5%,Tax6%
product1,1,12.4,5,6
product2,2,11.41,5,0
product3,2,4.6,0,0
</pre>
          </li>
          <li>there are else similar formats</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Beigesoft™ Accounting allows to make CSV file for numerous of demanded requirements. You can make any separated product or service price list.</p>
      
      <h4>Example of exporting price list into CSV file.</h4>
      <p>Assume we have three sales taxes: 	STG4.7%, STG6.4%, STS11%. POS wants CSV file like this:
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Product,ProductCode,Cost,Markup,Price,Tax,IsTaxIncudedInPrice,Discount,Supplier,Place,Quantity,Category,Variant,isService
product1,1,1.00,20.00,1.20,11.1,0,0.00,,room1,12,food,regular,0
product2,2,1.00,25.00,1.25,4.7,0,0.00,,room1,11,food,large,0
product3,3,2.00,25.00,2.50,0,0,0.00,,room1,11,drink,regular,0
</pre>
where tax means aggregate tax rate (percent).
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, add CsvMethod with data retriever "Product price list":
        <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/price-list-csv1.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>
        The first column is "Product" name, just pick "product->name" in "data path picker":
        <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/price-list-csv2.png" /></p>
        Second column is done in same way (pick product->ID).
      </p>
      <p>We do not want to pass data: cost, markup, supplier. Supplier is empty,
        place is constant "room a", IsTaxIncudedInPrice is constant 0, discount is constant 0, markup is constant 20.
        Cost is volatile thing and depends of used method (FIFO,etc). Sometimes, price can be less than cost.
        Data retriever always makes fake cost=price/1.2, so just pick "cost" in the picker. You can make any constant
        by putting its value to "constant" field.
        <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/price-list-csv.png" /></p>
        leave empty "constant" and "data path" to pass column's empty value (e.g. for supplier).
      </p>
      <p>
        Any product in beige-accounting can has only category (1-level category),
        e.g. here product1 has category "Food regular", product2 - "Food large", product3 - "Drink large".
        To make columns Category and Variant we will use product category ID and "Match Foreign" methods:
        <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/price-list-csv.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>
        To add any product in price list you should add "Price category", e.g. "price for shop in downtown":
        <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/price-list-csv.png" /></p>
        then "Good price":
        <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/price-list-csv.png" /></p>
        if you want to list unavailable product in the list, then set "special unavailable price",
        e.g. "999999".
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, to make CSV file open in menu "Pricing-Price list", select CSV Method and "Price category", then press "Report":
        <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/price-list-csv.png" /></p>
        *set "optimistic quantity" any number, e.g. 20, to set quantity and "isAvailable" for products that
        are not exist in warehouse. Set "Unavailable price" to make unavailable products that you want (i.e. their goods price = UP).
      </p>
      <h4>Troubleshooting.</h4>
      <p>Some software may require excessive non-standard things. For example passing price with currency code, e.g. "125.67USD", or decimal number with exactly 1 decimal place i.e. it can't handle value "12.10".
        Using excessive non-standard things is really not good feature. Any program language accepts decimal numbers "1" or "1.0" or "1.00" as 1.00.
