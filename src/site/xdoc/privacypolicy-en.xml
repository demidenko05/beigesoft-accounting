</p>
<p>
  If you set option <b>Show debug messages</b> to <b>ON</b> and <b>Debug detail level</b> to equals or grater than <b>30000</b>
  then log files <b>beige-accounting0.log</b> and <b>beige-accounting1.log</b> will contain sensitive data.
  In that case, if you are going to send these log files to a programmer (who customize this application),
  then you must remove sensitive data from these files.
</p>
<p>
  This is WEB-application, so you should use the newest version of WEB-browser. You should avoid to install any WEB-browser plugins.
</p>

<h4 align="center">Beigesoft™ Accounting standalone versions.</h4>
<p>These versions are based on embedded private A-Jetty WEB-server.
  This private WEB-server is not available from outside your computer (or Android device).
  These versions require authorization with strong password (created by you). They allow maximum 6 fail login attempts.
  The session will be blocked in 15 minutes after 6th fail login attempts.
  You should periodically check file <b>secure.log</b> that contains authorization information.
  These versions use modern encryption algorithms with strong keys for HTTPS connection and for safe encrypted file exchanging.
  These are multi-database versions, you can create new and switch the database from WEB-interface.
  If you a going to sent database file to another computer then you have to use WEB-interface for encrypting this file.
</p>

<h4 align="center">Beigesoft™ Accounting on embedded A-Jetty for ordinal computer.</h4>
<p>
  Your data is in database file, default is <b>webapp/beigeaccounting.sqlite</b>.
  You are able to copy (backup) database to a private place by using ordinal file manager.

<h4 align="center">Beigesoft™ Accounting on embedded A-Jetty for Android.</h4>
<p>
  Your data (SQLite databases), beige-accounting.log, secure.log, keystore (with secret keys) are in the private application storage.
  There is no way to read these files from there. Only this application can read and write these files.
  You can lost your data if you forget password (for keystore or/and application),
  so you should backup database files by using WEB-interface.
  This requires Beige-Accounting standalone version on another computer (or Android device),
  cause application encrypts files with public key that belong to another Beige-Accounting.
  Only another Beige-Accounting (whose public key used for encryption) can decrypts these encrypted files.
