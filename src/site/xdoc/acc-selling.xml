        16 Bob received on Jan 50USD prepayment from Mini Market.
        Bob has filled Prepayment From:
        <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting prepayment for sales" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/prepayment-for-sales.png" /></p>
        <p align="center">After accounting full report is:</p>
        <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting prepayment for sales report" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/prepayment-for-sales-report.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>
        Bob has sold on Jan 17 6 Pizza with bacon frozen and 6 Pizza with cheese frozen to Mini Market.
        Bob has filled Sales invoice:
        <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting sales invoice" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/sales1.png" /></p>
        <p align="center">After accounting full report is:</p>
        <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting sales invoice report" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/sales2.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>
        After that Bob has changed in accounting settings precision for trial balance to 4 then printed it:
        <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/trial-balance2.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ledger Inventory is:
        <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting Ledger Inventory" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/ledger-inventory1.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see Bob made another mistake. He set Sales date less than Manufacture date for that pizza, so
        balance of Inventory.Pizza Cheese Frozen is -23.5788 at 4:42 PM because it(pizza) was made at 6:40 PM.
        So it's reasonable to make database copy more frequently, he needs to copy beigeaccounting.sqlite
        by file explorer without exiting from accounting (on Android he should do it in the Database manager).
        Otherwise he should reverse whole document. For warehouse document date means nothing cause warehouse
        entries use current time. And you can't draw a product or material if it doesn't exist in warehouse.

      <h4>Payments tracking</h4>
      <p>Bob received on 18 Jan the rest 48.76 from Mini Market for sales invoice #1:
          <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting payment for sales" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/payment-for-sales.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>It make simple accounting entries:
          <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting payment for sales report" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/payment-for-sales-report.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>After what sales invoice's payment tracking fields in the list are changed:
          <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting payment for sales tracking" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/sales-payment-tracking.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>You can use filter for fields <b>Payment total</b> and <b>Pay by date</b> to report payments for sales:
          <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting report payments for sales" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/sales-payment-tracking2.png" /></p>
      </p>
