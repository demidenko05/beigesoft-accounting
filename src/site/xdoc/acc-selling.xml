    <section name="Accounting of sales, prepayments, payments tracking.">
      <p>
        At Jan 16 Bob receive 50USD prepayment from Seven Eleven.
        Bob fill Prepayment From:
        <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting prepayment for sales" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/prepayment-for-sales.png" /></p>
        <p align="center">After accounting full report is:</p>
        <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting prepayment for sales report" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/prepayment-for-sales-report.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>
        At Jan 17 Bob sold 6 Pizza with bacon frozen and 6 Pizza with cheese frozen to Seven Eleven.
        Bob fill Sales invoice:
        <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting sales invoice" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/sales1.png" /></p>
        <p align="center">After accounting full report is:</p>
        <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting sales invoice report" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/sales2.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>
        After that Bob makes in accounting settings precision for trial balance to 4 then print it:
        <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/trial-balance2.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ledger Inventory is:
        <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting Ledger Inventory" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/ledger-inventory1.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see Bob made another mistake. He set Sales date less than Manufacture date for that pizza, so
        balance of Inventory.Pizza Cheese Frozen is -22.986 at 4:42 PM because it(pizza) was made at 6:40 PM.
        So it's reasonable to make database copy more frequently, he need to copy beigeaccounting.sqlite
        by file explorer without exiting from accounting (on Android he should do it in the Database manager).
        Otherwise he should reverse whole document. For warehouse document date means nothing cause warehouse
        entries use current time. And you can't draw a product or material if it doesn't exist in warehouse.
      </p>

      <h4>Payments tracking</h4>
      <p>At 18 Jan Bob receive the rest 48.76 from Seven Eleven for sales invoice #1:
          <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting payment for sales" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/payment-for-sales.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>It make simple accounting entries:
          <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting payment for sales report" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/payment-for-sales-report.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>After what sales invoice payment tracking fields in list have changed:
          <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting payment for sales tracking" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/sales-payment-tracking.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>You can use filter for fields <b>Payment total</b> and <b>Pay by date</b> to report payments for sales:
          <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting report payments for sales" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/sales-payment-tracking2.png" /></p>
      </p>
