    <p>Keywords: Accounting of business owner taxes, retained earnings.</p>
<p>
  There are three Income Tax methods used in all countries:
  <ul>
    <li>income tax = rate * (business revenues - business expenses - allowances), and usually accrued method</li>
    <li>income tax = rate * (business revenues - allowances), and usually cash method</li>
    <li>income tax = fixed amount (e.g. 500USD per month.)</li>
  </ul> 
  Accrued means that business revenue/expense is occurred when you bought or sold something (goods, services, rent etc) even unpaid.
  Cash - when you earn money or paid ones, but not prepayments, i.e. for already sold/purchase goods/service.
  According <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p583.pdf">IRS 583 Starting a business, page 6</a>
  Bob as sole proprietor should pays Income Tax, Self-employment tax. He should pays estimated income tax
  by April 18 (see Form 1040-ES).
</p>
  
  <h4>Capitalized cost method.</h4>
  <p>Manufacturing (Producing) business activity often (in many countries) are subject of method "capitalized cost".
    For USA see <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p538.pdf">IRS 538, Page 18 Uniform Capitalization Rules</a>.
    According this method the most business expenses are required to be capitalized (i.e. placed into assets).
    For USA these expenses are - rent, electricity, indirect labor, property deprecation, sales tax from purchases etc.
    Part of those costs (or whole total) are deducting the tax at the end of period, and that "part" depends of starting and ending inventory (product).
    For example a factory has 0 notebooks at start and it has produced 1000 notebooks.
    They costs (capitalized) is 20000, and these costs are placed on asset accounts.
    At the end of period 900 notebooks are sold.
    So 90% of costs (18000) is deducting the tax, the rest 2000 is remained on assets.</p>

  <h4>Bob's earnings.</h4>
  <p>After Bob has made all business revenues and expenses his gross income is:
    <pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">
      gross income = sum(gross income revenue accounts) - sum(gross income expense accounts)
    </pre>
    His Self-employment tax is also gross income expense.
    <p>
      The final closing accounting entries are:
      <ul>
        <li>for each gross income revenue account for its final total: Debit [gross income revenue account] Credit Bob's earnings.</li>
        <li>for each gross income expense account for its final total: Debit Bob's earnings Credit [gross income expense account].</li>
        <li>Extract income tax from gross income: Debit Bob's earnings Credit Taxes Payable Federal Income Tax for tax amount.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
