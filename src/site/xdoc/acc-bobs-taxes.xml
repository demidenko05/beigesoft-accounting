    <section name="Accounting of business owner taxes, retained earnings.">
<p>
  There are three Income Tax methods used in all countries:
  <ul>
    <li>income tax = rate * (business revenues - business expenses - allowances), and usually accrued method</li>
    <li>income tax = rate * (business revenues - allowances), and usually cash method</li>
    <li>income tax = fixed amount</li>
  </ul> 
  Accrued means that business revenue/expense is occurred when you bought or sold something (goods, services, rent etc) even unpaid.
  Cash - when you earn money or paid ones, but not prepayments, i.e. for already sold/purchase goods/service.
  According <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p583.pdf">IRS 583 Starting a business</a> page 6
  Bob as sole proprietor should pays Income Tax, Self-employment tax. He should pays estimated income tax
  by April 18 (see Form 1040-ES). For manufacturing (according <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/capitalization-period-of-direct-and-indirect-costs">IRS Capitalization Period of Direct and Indirect Costs</a>)
  direct business expenses such as cost of goods sold is made automatically
  directly on gross income (business) expense account <b>Cost Of Goods Sold (COGS)</b>. All other expenses is accounted on asset account
  <b>Inventory capitalized cost (ICC)</b>. To calculate amount of <b>Inventory capitalized cost</b> to be expense
  it's used trial balance at the start and the end of the year and this equation:
  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
    1. Simplified Production Absorption Ratio = (ICC end - ICC start) / (Inventory end - Inventory start + COGS end)
    2. ICC amount to be expense = (ICC end - ICC start) - Inventory end * Simplified Production Absorption Ratio
  </pre>
  Bob's balance is zero at the start. For example at the end of the year Inventory = 1500USD, COGS = 240000USD,
  ICC = 25000USD. So Bob will makes accounting entries Debit COGS Additional Credit ICC
  for whole ICC = 25000 - 1500 * 25000 /(1500 + 240000) = 24844.72USD
  <p>Bob should makes several accounting entries for each type of expense (ICC - rent, payroll tax1, etc) by using Simplified Production Absorption Ratio.</p>
</p>
  
  <h4>Bob's earnings.</h4>
  <p>After Bob has made all business revenues and expenses his gross income is:
    <pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">
      gross income = sum(gross income revenue accounts) - sum(gross income expense accounts)
    </pre>
    His Self-employment tax is also none-capitalized cost and gross income expense.
    <p>
      The final closing accounting entries are:
      <ul>
        <li>for each gross income revenue account for its final total: Debit [gross income revenue account] Credit Bob's earnings.</li>
        <li>for each gross income expense account for its final total: Debit Bob's earnings Credit [gross income expense account].</li>
        <li>Extract income tax from gross income: Debit Bob's earnings Credit Taxes Payable Federal Income Tax for tax amount.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
