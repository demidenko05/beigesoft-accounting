    <p>Keywords: Accounting of sales taxes cash method, cash vs accrual methods.</p>

    <h4>Base principles.</h4>
    <p>At first, it's need to understand these things:
      <ul>
        <li>Prepaid merchandise - means that buyer has paid 100% for merchandise and has not yet received it (merchandise).</li>
        <li>Paid merchandise - means that buyer has paid/prepaid 100% for merchandise and has received it (merchandise).</li>
        <li>Prepaid/paid partially - means that buyer has paid less then 100% for merchandise.</li>
        <li>Sold merchandise - means that buyer has received merchandise*.</li>
      </ul>
      *for some countries term "sold" may means also "merchandise is sent to buyer". In Beige-Accounting "sold/bought" means when invoice is accounted.
    </p>
    <p>Accrual or cash method is dedicated to estimate income tax "WHEN" (all other taxes usually have the same method as income tax).</p>
    <p>The most used method for income tax is:
    <pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">
      Income tax = (Business revenue - Business expenses) * Tax Rate
    </pre>
    There are two methods "WHEN" revenue or expense is occurred:
    <ul>
      <li>CASH method - means that expense/revenue/tax is occurred when merchandise is sold and paid.</li>
      <li>ACCRUAL method - means that expense/revenue/tax is occurred when merchandise is sold (even unpaid or partially paid).</li>
    </ul>
    Cash method is used in tax accounting only in simple cases - when income is low.
    Accrual is only reliable method to properly estimate business results and it is used in market (financial) accounting.
    If you have choice between these methods for tax accounting, then you should better opt accrual method.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Sales taxes cash method</h4>
    <p>In some countries the law may demand to use cash method to estimate sales taxes despite of using accrual method for income tax.</p>
    <p>Beigesoft ™ accounting since 1.1.6 version has implemented this method for sales, purchases and their returns*.</p>
    <p>*You should do accounting tax entries by hand in case if where is return from purchase/sales and that purchase/sales did not paid 100% yet.
      For sales returns you can manually switch to "ON" accrual method #38 if the sales invoice paid.
    </p>
