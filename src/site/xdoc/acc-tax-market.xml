      <h4>Market accounting.</h4>
      <p>
        IRS demands Bob to keep entries (in either single entry or in double entries accounting system)
        to estimate his taxes in calendar year period. Bob want to estimate his real business results
        monthly. Market accounting (double entries system) based on rule:
        <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
          Assets - Liabilities = how much does Bob's business cost (he can sold it) = Owner's equity
        </pre>
      </p>
      <b>
        The most entries from Tax accounting is relevant for Market one. Excluding entries are:
        <ul>
          <li>Property deprecation</li>
          <li>Closing entries (yearly)</li>
          <li>All bad debts entries</li>
          <li>Credit inventory capitalized cost entries (yearly).</li>
        </ul>
      </b>

      <p>Bob create new Beige Accounting Market in same way as <a href="acc-settings.html">Software installation, accounting settings, chart of accounts, started capital.</a>
        except "Chart of accounts", "Expenses" and "Started capital". He uses <b>c:\beige-accounting-market</b> folder for market accounting.
        He edit file <b>c:\beige-accounting-market\webapp\WEB-INF\web.xml</b> with <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> to change database ID:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/market-acc-id.png" /></p>

      <h4>Import data from tax accounting.</h4>
      <p>
        He launch source (tax) database Tax Beige Accounting: either double click on <b>startup8081.bat</b> or start terminal (CMD in beige-accounting folder) and enter
        <b>java -jar beige-accounting-ajetty-jar-with-dependencies.jar port=8081</b> (port must not be 8080!).
        Then he launch market accounting (in <b>beige-accounting-market</b> folder) on port 8080.
      </p>
      <p>
        He use "menu - about" in tax accounting to know its ID:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/tax-acc-about.png" /></p>
      <p>
        He added Replication accounting method with entries filters:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/replication-acc-method.png" /></p>
      <p>
        He fill import acc. entries form (WEB-service address is "http://localhost:8081/secure/sendEntities") and press replicate:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting import from tax to market(business) accounting" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/import_acc_entries_form.png" /></p>
      <p>
        Report of import acc. entries is:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/import_acc_entries_result.png" /></p>
      
      <h4>Property asset market cost</h4>
      <p>If you bought something then you can't sold it for the same price. Bob think that he can sold his Ford
      right now (in January) for 20000 USD, so he report Ford cost loss:</p>
      <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/ford_cost_loss.png" /></p>

      <h4>Accounting of bad debts</h4>
      <p>In opposite to tax accounting Bob want to report loss immediately. Funny coffee shop bad debt is 32.92.
         But if IRS has approved this bad debt, then Bob's income tax deducting will be roughly 32.92 * 25% = 8.23 (25 is predicted tax rate).
         So he create new asset account <b>Income Tax Deducting</b>:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/income-tax-deducting-acc.png" /></p>
      <p>Note that ID for account must be a word without spaces maximum 25 letters!</p>
      <p>Then Bob transfer 8.23 into it, and the rest into <b>Other loses</b>:</p>
      <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/acc-market-bad-debt.png" /></p>

      <h4>Closing of inventory capitalized cost monthly.</h4>
      <p>Bob believes that these expenses should not be capitalized (increased assets). Any asset should has current market cost,
      and it (cost) never depends of "how much does it cost to you".
      He just transfer their full amount into <b>Other loses</b> account using trial balance:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/acc-market-blnsicc.png" /></p>
      <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/market-closing-icc.png" /></p>

      <p>* to be brief sample database <b>bobs-pizza-market.sqlite</b> contains of summary revenue and expenses entries instead of lot of Purchase and Sales invoices,
      so trial balance on 31 Jan is:</p>
      <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/market-trial-jan.png" /></p>
      
      <h4>Closing entries monthly, balance sheet.</h4>
      <p>Bob makes at 31 Jan closing entries into <b>Retained Earnings</b> account:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting closing entries" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/market-closing-jan.png" /></p>
      
      <p>After that gross revenue is 8998.3308. Bob's income tax roughly is 8998.3308 * 25% = 2249.5827, so Bob transfer
      it from <b>Retained Earnings</b>:</p>
      <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/market-jan-inc-tax.png" /></p>
      
      <p>As a result the balance sheet on 31 Jan is:</p>
      <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/market-jan-balance.png" /></p>
      <p>So Bob earn 6748.75 USD in January(*) and his business market cost is 46748.75 USD.</p>
      <p>* take note that it is a simple example which does not included other taxes and their properly rates.</p>
      
      <h4>Accounting of business (trade) name.</h4>
      <p>In February Bob sell pizza for 37000 USD, expenses is 11000 USD. So gross income = 26000 USD,
      income tax = 6500 USD (Bob earns 19500 in Feb vs 6750 in Jan). Bob closes February with result: his business market cost is 66248.75.
      But at this time (Feb 29 evening) a reliable businessman call Bob and ask him that he wants to buy Bob's pizza business for 80000 USD.
      Bob refuse this offer and report this event (increased business cost for 13751.2492) with new asset account <b>Bob's pizza name</b>:
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting of business (trade) name" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/market-business-name.png" /></p>
      <p>Business (trade) name cost always reflect to quantity of customers that prefer its (business maker's) goods or services.</p>
      <p>So February balance sheet is:</p>
      <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting balance sheet" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/market-feb-balance-sheet.png" /></p>
      <p>* Despite of rough income tax estimation, it would be better to use separate expense accounts for "expenses that deduct income tax" and "that doesn't".</p>
