     <p>Keywords: Accounting of purchase returns.</p>

      <p>On 16 Jan Bob found what 12 eggs and 1 pound of cheese are not fresh.
        At first he switched off method #31 "PurchaseReturn, Debit ReturnsReceivable.DebtorCreditor Credit SalesTaxFromPurchReturns.Tax for Tax amount. Accrual Symmetric." in the accounting settings.
        Then he has made purchase return to Carlo's grocery:
        <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting purchase returns" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/purchase-return.png" /></p>
        * since 1.1.7 version, you can change cost (it's still picked automatically), and you can change tax amount (if taxes are extracted from purchase).
      </p>
      <p>Field <b>Site from</b> is optional. If it's empty then withdrawal will be from the first warehouse
        site/s with available item/s.</p>
      <p>Purchase return makes complex accounting, warehouse and draw goods entries:
        <p align="center"><img alt="Beige-Accounting purchase return report" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/purchase-return-report.png" /></p>
        * software makes automatically report about rounding error - "7.0100!=7.0063!" in this case.
      </p>

      <p>After that purchase invoice full report shows goods withdrawal:
        <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/purchase-report-after-return.png" /></p>
      </p>
