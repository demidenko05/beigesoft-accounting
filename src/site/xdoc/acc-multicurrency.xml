      <h4>Multi currency, exchange gain or loss.</h4>
      <p>If you sell goods that is paid in foreign currency, and you use ACCRUAL method (you have to report revenue for unpaid sales),
        and currency exchange rate is different when payment is occurred, then you face "exchange difference".
        You will never face exchange difference if you use CASH method.</p>
      <p>The most countries have similar law about selling/buying in foreign currency, that is:
      <ul>
        <li>you have to make records in national currency.</li>
        <li>selling/buying transaction is made with current exchange rate (booking date)</li>
        <li>payment transaction is made with current exchange rate (payment date)</li>
        <li>difference between booking and payment rates (gain or loss) is business revenue or expense.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
